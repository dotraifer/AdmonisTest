# AdmonisTest

This project is a solution to the Admonis homework assignment,
where the goal is to parse product data from an XML file,
map it to AdmonisProduct and AdmonisProductOption objects,
and output a structured list of products with their variants to a var called results, 
and then write them to a JSON in the desired path.

## How to Run

* Clone the repository or download the solution.
* Place the XML file (e.g., products.xml) in the project directory.
* Update the XmlFilePath variable in the Main method with the XML file's path.
* Update the OutputJsonPath variable in the Main method with the desired output path.
* Build and run the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# environment.
